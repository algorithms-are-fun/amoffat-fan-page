# Contributing

Anybody can contribute to the fan page! However, the website's direction is determined by the author(s), just like any other responsible software. Before you begin, please have a quick read on [code of contuct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Website's direction
As of now, there isn't a solid direction set for the website. However, Algorithms are Fun is aimed to:
* Encourage students to participate in open-source software
* Show off contributors' creativity
The "Fan Page" is just a way for students to easily understand the theme and start building habits in contributing to open-source software.

## If you have an idea for the fan page
1. Create a Github issue with RFC label, along with descriptions of your idea (hopefully short and easy to understand, better if assisted with pictures).
2. Moderator(s) will discuss whether to have your  idea approved or not. This will also determine how the idea will be implemented.
3. If approved, a new issue will be created with "feature" label. All code must be commited with this issue number.

## If you would like to work on an approved feature
Please have a read on how Git Flow works first. Then:

1. Create a new branch, ideally same name as the Github issue (ie. feature/issue-name-here)
2. Please follow the implementation instructions. If you have a better idea, please discuss in the ticket with the selected approver for the issue.
3. Once implemented, please create a pull request to the development branch. The approver will take appropriate action afterwards. You may be required to make changes.

Please don't forget to state authorship in the comments of your committing code.
