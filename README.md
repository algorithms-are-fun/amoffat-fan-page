## What is this?
This is a [Alistair Moffat](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/) fan page source code repository. Who is Alistair Moffat? Overall passionate and entertaining lecturer who cares a lot about his students and has enough street cred to have his students set something up like this voluntarily. "Algorithms are fun" and "Programming is fun" are his punch lines in his lectures.

The project's main aim is to encourage students/beginners to contribute to open-source software with easy barrier of entry. The goal is to build students/beginners habit into working in online collaborative environment.
 
## Getting Started
Alistair Moffat fan page "Algorithms are Fun" is written in React, compiled into basic HTML/CSS/JS using [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js). To get started with your development environment:

```
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

Please have a read through Next.js to understand project structure.

## QnA
_Q:_ Why use React + SCSS for such a simple website?  
_A:_ TLDR: I wanted basic OO frontend development that everybody knows (or useful to know). Why OO? Everybody (and their dumb dog) understands OO and Object-Oriented Software Design. SCSS because there were some features I find useful in group work.

_Q:_ Why make this?  
_A:_ Why Alistair Moffat: Go attend one of his lectures. Why do this: as mentioned above, also for myself to build my skills in open-source project management.

_Q:_ Why such a strict development process?  
_A:_ Just incase a lot of students want to start contributing and I do not want my repo to be filled with inconsistent code from students.

_Q:_ Who is paying for the domains?  
_A:_ I am (Max Lee), just for fun. If you feel like helping out, buy me a bottle of coke when you bump into me (or coffee, but something sweet please).
