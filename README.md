# Algorithms are Fun!
aka. Programming is Fun (for Engineering Computation students).  
Visit the fan page at [algorithmsarefun.com](https://algorithmsarefun.com) or [algorithmsare.fun](https://algorithmsare.fun)

*STATUS: UNRELEASED, UNDER DEVELOPMENT, NO RFCS WILL BE PROCESSED*

## What is this?
This is a [Alistair Moffat](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/) fan page source code repository. Who is Alistair Moffat? Overall passionate and entertaining lecturer who cares a lot about his students and has enough street cred to have his students set something up like this voluntarily. "Algorithms are fun" and "Programming is fun" are his punch lines in his lectures.
 
## Getting Started
Alistair Moffat fan page "Algorithms are Fun" is written in React, compiled into basic HTML/CSS/JS using [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js). To get started with your development environment:
```
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

## Contributing
Anybody can contribute to the fan page! However, the website's direction is determined by the author(s), just like any other responsible software.

If you have an idea for the fan page:
1. Create a Github issue with RFC label, along with descriptions of your idea (hopefully short and easy to understand, better if assisted with pictures).
2. Author(s) will discuss whether to have your  idea approved or not. This will also determine how the idea will be implemented.
3. If approved, a new issue will be created with "feature" label. All code must be commited with this issue number.

If you would like to work on an approved feature, please have a read on how Git Flow works first. Then:
1. Create a new branch, ideally same name as the Github issue (ie. feature/issue-name-here)
2. Please follow the implementation instructions. If you have a better idea, please discuss in the ticket with the selected approver for the issue.
3. Once implemented, please create a pull request to the development branch. The approver will take appropriate action afterwards. You may be required to make changes.

Please don't forget to state authorship in the comments of your committing code.

## Disclaimer
This project is completely independent of Alistair Moffat. This project is purely organized by [Max Lee](https://mallocsizeof.me), now graduated student of Alistair's.

## QnA
_Q:_ Why use React for such a simple website?
_A:_ TLDR; I wanted basic OO frontend development that everybody knows (or useful to know). Why OO? Everybody (and their dumb dog) understands OO and Object-Oriented Software Design.

_Q:_ Why make this?
_A:_ Go attend one of his lectures.

_Q:_ Why such a strict development process?
_A:_ Just incase shit tonnes of students want to start contributing and I do not want my repo to be filled with shit code from students :P (PS. I tutor at the university outside working hours and I know what average students write)

_Q:_ Who is paying for the domain?
_A:_ I am (Max Lee), just for fun. If you feel like helping out, buy me a bottle of coke (or coffee, but something sweet please).
